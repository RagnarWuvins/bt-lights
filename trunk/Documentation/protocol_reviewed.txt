
BT Lights Serial Protocol (2.0)

Command classes (4bit)[0:3]:
channel		=	0x01	single channel command
global		=	0x02	global setting command
at cmd		=	0x03	AT command for the BT chip
port		=	0x04	direct port command that controls netduino functions

Channel mode (4bit)[4:7]:
No Change 	=	0x00	no change of current mode
Set			=	0x01	set value
Get			=	0x02	get value
Max			=	0x03	set max value
Min			=	0x04	get max value
Mode1		=	0x05	set Mode1 (Fade)
Mode2		=	0x06	set Mode2 (Sweep In)
Mode3		= 	0x07	set Mode3 (Sweep Out)

Address (16bit)[8:23]:
Channels can be address by a seperate bit in the command. Thus making it possible to send
commands simultaniously.
In global mode the addresses are use as command type (?)


Channel value (8bit)[24:31]:
All values from 0 to 255

CRC (8bit)[32:39]
The CRC is the sum of CLA, MOD and VAL


Example:
Set channel 1 to fade (value doesn't matter)

|CLA |MOD |       ADR         |   VAL   |   CRC   | 
|0001|0101|0000|0000|0000|0001|0000|0000|0000|0006|
