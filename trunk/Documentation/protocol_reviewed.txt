
BT Lights Serial Protocol (2.0)

Command classes (4bit)[0:3]:
channel		=	0x00	single channel command
global		=	0x01	global setting command
at cmd		=	0x02	AT command for the BT chip
port		=	0x03	direct port command that controls netduino functions

Channel mode (4bit)[4:7]:
No Change 	=	0x00	no change of current mode
Direct Mode	=	0x01	set value
On			=	0x02	set to On
Off			=	0x03	set to off
Func		=	0x04	set a preprogrammed function
Get value	=	0x05	Get value of channel(s)
Set Max		=	0x06	set maximum value of channel(s)
Set Min		= 	0x07	set minimum value of channel(s)
Set Delay	= 	0x08	set delay value of channel(s)
Set Period	= 	0x09	set period value of channel(s)
Restart		= 	0x0A	restart timer of channel(s)

Address (16bit)[8:23]:
Channels can be address by a seperate bit in the command. Thus making it possible to send
commands simultaniously.
In global mode the addresses are use as command type (?)


Channel value (8bit)[24:31]:
All values from 0 to 255

CRC (8bit)[32:39]
The CRC is the sum of CLA, MOD and VAL (has an overflow so this is not a real CRC)


Example:
Set channel 1 to fade (value doesn't matter)

|CLA |MOD |       ADR         |   VAL   |   CRC   |
|0000|0100|0000|0000|0000|0001|0000|0000|0000|0100|
|  byte 0 |  byte 1 |  byte 2 |  byte 3 |  byte 4 |
