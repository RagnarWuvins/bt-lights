== Command Types ==

|| *Type* || *Definition* ||
|| at || AT commands for the bluetooth module ||
|| cc || Channel commands that address each channel ||

Upper or lower case will be ignored for all commands.

For an exact definition please see the BT firmware [https://code.google.com/p/bt-lights/source/browse/trunk/Documentation/HC-0305%20serail%20module%20AT%20commamd%20set%20201104%20revised.pdf documentation].
These commands are actually a wrapper for the BT serial connection. They will be forwarded by the hardware and will not need the "\n\r" at the end.
