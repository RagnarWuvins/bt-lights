#summary BT - Lights with EL wire main page
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />


= Introduction =
This project will be about a bluetooth control for a 16 channel EL wire dimmer. The hardware is realized with Netduino / Arduino and additional peripherie.

PROGRESS:
* Almost all channel commands are implemented (documentation will follow, so far only in code comments and in text file)
* Some general commands are done, the most critical I guess
* Still some work to do for the buffer control (too many overflows in the error log)
* Android App has been started. Phew Bluetooth looks a bit different here. :/

= Documentation =
* [doumentationBTProtocol Serial Protocol]

= Requirements: =

== Open: ==
 * Android implementation
 * Portation from Netduino to Arduino


== Closed: ==
 * Library for using dimming hardware
 * Dimming hardware for 8 and 16 channels
 * protocol for BT interface on Netduino
 * Find BT firmware that can be used with Android Phones.
 * Test Firmware on Netduino to configure BT module and send commands
